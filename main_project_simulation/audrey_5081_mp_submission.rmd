High-level overview: 
    End point of this simulation is a set of structural
    equation models, which are in practice connecting sets of many variable's
    associations with each other. And in the context of field ecology, a lot of 
    things such as linear mixed models are utilized.

```{r}
HS.model <- ' visual =~ x1 + x2 + x3
textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6
speed =~ x7 + x8 + x9 '
fit <- cfa(HS.model, data=HolzingerSwineford1939)
semPaths(fit)
