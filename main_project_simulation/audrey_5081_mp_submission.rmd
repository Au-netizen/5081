High-level statistical overview: 
    End point of this simulation is a set of structural equation models aka SEMs
    , which are in practice connecting sets of many variable's associations with 
    each other. And in the context of field ecology, a lot of things such as 
    linear mixed models are utilized.

Experimental design:
    10 study sites, which each have a control and treatment location, likely 
    with 5 days of surveying at each site. Bees are sampled for both their
    abundance and species composition. Sites need to be at least 500m apart from
    one another based on current research precedence (Fitch et al 2021).
    Sampling must occur at specific appropriate weather conditions, from 09:00
    to 17:30, within a temperature range of 20 to 35Â°C, some amount of sun and
    wind speeds not over 4 m/s (Brown et al, 2024). These conditions of sampling
    are meant to provide appropriate timing for bees to be present, which are
    then used for measuring abundance and Shannon-diversity index data (Ferrari
    et al, 2022).
    Separately, plant diversity is measured. For plant abundance it is more 
    complicated but a very readily available species can be utilized instead, ie
    Trifolium pratense L. (Hennig et al, 2011). For the purposes of this
    simulation, bee and plant abundance will be ignored, but eventually they
    will be a factor.
    These sites are specifically roadsides, which creates additional variables
    of road width (Fitch et al, 2021), noise pollution and more physical
    contaminants from cars ie metals are added factors (Phillips et al, 2021).
    There is also excess salt usage to factor in areas such as the study site of
    Toronto, where road salt used from the winter will inevitably seep into
    roadside soil (Caplan et al, 2024).
    Lastly, water runoff is a variable which is to be sampled and studied as
    well, but I am still undecided if this should be a dataset only looking at
    the volume of water in runoff, or contents (pollution) of urban runoff water
    (Zhange et al, 2010).

Lower-level statistical overview:
    The SEM is bee diversity as top endogenous aka dependent variable, then
    plant diversity, noise pollution and road width as its exogenous aka 
    independent variables. Soil contamination is plant diversity's independent
    variable.
    I will be assuming normal distribution for all variables present in the
    context of this simulation, and linear mixed models will be utilized as this
    is not an ideal/optimal data set, there are practical restrictions such as
    which residential site owners are ok with fieldwork occuring at their
    property, mowing schedule of the city for public sites etc. Likewise the
    Shannon index data will not be included for the purposes of this simulation
    as abundance values need to be included, which is still a work in process
    and importantly no current research precedence of utilizing Shannon
    diversity indexes for this specific study design (urban roadside
    pollination).
