BIOL5081 Draft Methods Section (field/lab methods)

Summarized overview of grad project
	Looking at the conditions of roadside plant patches that enable higher 
	abundance of pollinators, in particular bee species, sorted by different
	possible independent variables in this setting. Data points of this can be
	bee species composition, bee abundance for a given species, bee abundance
	for all species, proportionate bee species composition for every given site.
		Some traits are pretty simple to measure ie road width, just look at 
		google maps or a GIS.
		Others are more tricky, ie soil data. Soil core samples needed then
		analyzed in a seperate facility where after I get composition data of
		various materials minerals etc to work with.
		In total the variables potentially affecting bee variables are: road
		width, average noise (from cars mostly...) over 24hrs or maybe over a
		week, average noise during the hours ideal/most common for bee
		pollination during a day where weather conditions are favourable for
		them, traffic density (this one is tricky, hard to say if it will be
		categorical or quantitative), proximity of larger pollinating plant
		sites/parks

Exclusion criteria:
	Highways and in particular their intersections were not included even though
	they in some ways fill the criteria for the study (chunk of plants by roads)
	they are significantly different from the rest of current study sites in how
	intense the density of traffic is, specific elevation changes for the plants
	patch compared to the more residential/urban sites.
	Some capacity of native pollinating plants, or perhaps another way of
	putting it is plants that one would see in wilderness/park patches (because
	some non-native plants have become especially successful in Ontario, and can
	be significant pollinators) is needed for a site to be suitable for a study
	site. Basically stuff like specfically picked vines roses etc are not 
	suitable.
	There should be a 500m radius from a study site to other study sites, based
	on established threshold of movement patterns of bees (another way of
	saying is that sites need to be 1km apart).
	The plant patches have to be beside roads with car traffic, ie train, bike,
	tram traffic does not work here. Walking trails do not fit, basically it is
