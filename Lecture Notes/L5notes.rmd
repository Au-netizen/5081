Binomial distribution is just amount of two outcome tests

Logistic regression can model probability of a discrete outcome y
    can describe this with a linear function

odds ratio is is back-transformed from the log of everything
a logistic model over linear model will have an intersection point/inflection
point, which defines "we expect zeros vs we expect ones"
    sigmoid function s curve for logistic model

odds ratio us ubcreased ir decreased idds if iytcine y per unit increase of x;
because it's a ratio a value of 1 is just equally likely, more than 1 is more
likely, less than 1 is less likely
    in practice a constant value is iffy, because of stuff like diminishing
    returns toxicity etc

poisson uses count data ie number of things
transofrms non-linear to linear form to make the rest of our work easier

negative binomial when variance is larger than mean, so a more flexible model
than poisson because poisson assumption is that variance equals mean
