Week 4 methods draft

Conceptual overview of data sets:
    End point is bee species abundance and frequency of given species per study 
    sites
        From this there are series of independent variables that may be tied to 
        the bee variables: road width, loudness, proximity of larger parks/plant
        zones near the study site
        There is also plant abundance and composition per site, which may also 
        be influenced by: road width, soil width, soil composition data, water 
        runoff and.or rainwater volume, (potentially)

Types of statistical models to consider:
    Structural equation mode:

```{r simulate trait of interest}
rnorm(1000, 0, 10)->trait_of_interest

plot(density(trait_of_interest))
min(trait_of_interest)
max(trait_of_interest)
